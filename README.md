# Akeno

Akeno is a lovely bot who is ready to track your users ratings.

## About Akeno

At this very moment Akeno keeps ranking of the server members. If you invite bot to your server, make sure to add your server to the database. You can do that by typing `!addserver` command. Every server member has to manually join the system by typing `!join_h` command. 

### User honoring system

System uses points, which are called "_honor points_" to rank each user. User can get honor points only from other users. If user wants to honor any server member he can do it with several commands (watch commands section). **Both, sender and receiver, must be registered in the database**. I decided not to force anyone and not to save any data without anyone's aknowledgement, so **each member in order to honor or be honored has to join the system manually, by typing** `!join_h` **command**. 

Each user has two pools of honors: how many time user was honored and how many spare honors he can give to others. These are two different pools and they never mix.
